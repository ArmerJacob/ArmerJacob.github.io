Hello! My name is Jacob (Jake) and I am a student at the University of Hull studying Computer Science.
Over the time I have spent with the University of Hull I have worked on several projects both
for the University and also as personal projects.

## 3D Lighting:

As a piece of coursework i was tasked with creating a 2D simulation with basic physics.

## DnD Initiative Calculator:

## Other Projects:

These are some other non-programming projects that i pursue mainly out of an interest and love for them.

### Youtube Channel:

I do run a youtube channel and create video reviews of video games for fun. This is mostly because of a love of video editing that I have,
and scince finishign at college and not doing Creative Media anymore, i felt a need to scratch the video editing itch that it left me with.

### Card Game:

For as long as i can remember i have loved board games, growing up playing Cluedo with my family, i also played a lot of the Pokemon trading card game
and as i became a teenager i discovered Magic the Gathering that i still play to this day. And so because of this i have always wanted to create my own 
card game that people could enjoy as much as i did as a child.

####The Seven Snakes VS Giants:

This is a card game i have been slowly working on in my free time based on a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that me and my friends played, where the character cards
are our characters. I have created a digital mock up of the card game that is playable on Tabletop Simulator, and after i gather up enough art assets i intend on having
this be printed and published.
