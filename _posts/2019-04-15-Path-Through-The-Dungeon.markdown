description: Path Through the Dungeon is a four player co-op dungeon crawler, made in the Unity 3D engine. The map is generated at different sizes depending on how many players there are, with random traps placed within the level. Working as a group for a piece of coursework, we were tasked with going through the entire software life cycle, from design to release, all within five weeks. My role within the group was third programmer, my main task being the implementation of the level generation and randomisation, as well as the algorithm that determines difficulty. In addition, I generally assisted with the development of other mechanics within the game.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SikWfdO10fk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
