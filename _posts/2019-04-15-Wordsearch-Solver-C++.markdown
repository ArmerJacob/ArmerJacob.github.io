category: Wordsearch Solver C++
description: In order to show my understanding of C++, I developed a program that used linked lists to find words in a word search. Additionally, the program also times itself, drawing comparisons from more simple methods of solving the word search. The code for this project can be found on my Github <u><a href="https://github.com/ArmerJacob/Advanced-Programming-Coursework"  target="_blank" > Here!</a></u>
