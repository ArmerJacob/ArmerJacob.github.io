description: I have always loved board games and card games, growing up playing Cluedo with my family, i also played a lot of the Pokemon trading card game and as i became a teenager i discovered Magic the Gathering that i still play to this day. And so because of this i have always wanted to create my own card game that people could enjoy as much as i did as a child. This is a card game i have been slowly working on in my free time based on a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that me and my friends played, where the character cards are our characters. I have created a digital mock up of the card game that is playable on Tabletop Simulator, and after i gather up enough art assets i intend on having this be printed and published.
