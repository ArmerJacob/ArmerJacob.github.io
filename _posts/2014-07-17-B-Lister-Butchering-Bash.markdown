This was built from the ground up using OpenGL, and was later repurposed for use on the 3D Gorillas project. <br><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwVj4e4HU9E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
