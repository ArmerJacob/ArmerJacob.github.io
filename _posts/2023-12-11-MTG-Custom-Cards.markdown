description: Designing custom cards for TCGs has been something I have done since I was a child. I would sketch out little drawings with custom abilities and such for my Pokemon cards. As an adult however, while toying around with the new AI art tool Midjourney, I realised that for a bit of fun between myself and my friends, I could create custom MTG cards for use between ourselves, so I made cards based on our DnD characters, and it was fun to show them off. A week later, I had completed a full 100 Card pre-constructed Commander deck, all from cards that were flavoured around our DnD campaign, another week passed and I had another entire 100 Card deck based around the villains of the campaign.  I intended to create a balanced set of cards, that would fit in within a normal game of MTG Commander, and from various test games with my friends it seems to have worked, there are still some minor issues, but overall it was an excellent exersise in design. A full list of the cards can be found here: "https://www.mtgnexus.com/customcards/17405-terra-primus/"
