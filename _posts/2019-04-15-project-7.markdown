description: Path Through the Dungeon is a 4 Player Co-Op dungeon crawler, where the map is generated different sizes depenign on how many players, with random traps placed within the level. As a group Coursework for Commercial Games Development we were tasked with coming up with a game idea, and creating it within 5 weeks in a group, my role within the group was 3rd programmer and my main job was to impliment the Map generation and randomisation as well as the algorithm that determines difficulty, however i also helped impliment other aspects of the game. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SikWfdO10fk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
