description: In my free time, I play Dungeons & Dragons with my friends. In a quest to make things as simple as possible for us, I have created a calculator that will track combat encounters for our group, with saved values for the players which can be edited; monsters are able to be dynamically added. The aim for this was to streamline a process that, for our group, was tedious.
