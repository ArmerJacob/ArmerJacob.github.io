description: In my free time I play quite a lot of Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. And in a quest to make things as simple as possible for us, I have created this, a Calculator that will track combat encounters for our group, with saved values for the players can can be edited, and monsters are able to be dynamically added, the aim for this was to stream line a process that for some unknown reason always too a little too long for out group to do.
