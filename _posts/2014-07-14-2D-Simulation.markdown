description: A coursework for university, written in Javascript, this is a 2D simulation where two circles bounce around and eventually settle. This was made from the ground up starting with drawing 2D lines and building to have shapes and animations and then finally physics. The code for this project can be found on my Github <a href="https://github.com/ArmerJacob/2D-Coursework."  target="_blank" > Here!</a>
