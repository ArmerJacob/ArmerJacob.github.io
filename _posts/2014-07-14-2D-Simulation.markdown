description: This was an early piece I developed from the ground up, starting by drawing 2D lines and building to have shapes and animations, and finally physics. This 2D simulation was written in Javascript. The code for this project can be found on my Github <u><a href="https://github.com/ArmerJacob/2D-Coursework."  target="_blank" > Here!</a></u><br><br><br><canvas id="mainCanvas" width="900" height="650"> Your browser does not support the canvas tag </canvas> <script src="/js/main.js"></script>
