category: Wordsearch Solver C++
description: As coursework we were required to use C++ and make a program that used Linked Lists to find words in a wordsearch and also time how quickly it would do this, and compare those times to a more simple method of solving the word searched. The code for this project can be found on my Github <a href="https://github.com/ArmerJacob/Advanced-Programming-Coursework"  target="_blank" > Here!</a>
