description: I have always loved board games and card games, growing up playing Cluedo with my family, and the Pok√©mon trading card game in the playground. As I matured, I discovered Magic: The Gathering that I still play to this day. My experience with these types of game have led me to want to create my own card game that people could enjoy as much as I did as a child. This is a card game I have gradually been developing in my free time based on a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that my friends and I played, the cards being our characters. I have created a digital mock up of the card game that is playable on Tabletop Simulator, and after I source art assets, I intend on publishing it.
